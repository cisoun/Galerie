## Installation

Just copy [index.php](index.php) and your pictures into a folder on your server.

## F.A.Q

> Can I add another image format?

Yes. Just add the extension in the header PHP code.

> How can I prepare my photos easily?

You can use GraphicsImagick (or ImageMagick) to optimise your photos.  
For instance, transform your photos by running this command:

```sh
for i in *.jpg; do
	gm convert $i -resize 1500x1500 photos/$(basename $i)
done
```

> I don't need lazy loading, how can I remove it?

Remove the `getimagesize` PHP call and the `loading="lazy"` attribute in the `<img>` element.
