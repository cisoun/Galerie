## Installation

1) Copy [`index.php`](index.php) into a folder.
2) Copy your JPEG files into an `img` subfolder.

## F.A.Q

**Q: Can I use something else than JPEG?**
A: Yes. Just change the extension in the PHP code at the top of the file.

**Q: How can I prepare my photos easily?**
A: You can use GraphicsImagick (or ImageMagick) to optimise your photos.
For instance, put your photos in the folder of *Galerie* then run this command:

```sh
for i in *.jpg; do
	gm convert $i -resize 1500x1500 img/$(basename $i)
done
```
